        <p> 1984â€“1989: Formation and early years

          <em>The original lineup</em> in a 1988 promo. From left: Jerry Cantrell, Sean Kinney, Mike Starr, Layne Staley.
          Before the formation of Alice in Chains, Layne Staley, a drummer at the time,landed his first gig 
          as a vocalist when he auditioned to sing for a local glam metal band known as Sleze after receiving some 
          encouragement from his stepbrother Ken Elmer. Other members of this group at that time were 
          guitarists Johnny Bacolas and Zoli Semanate, drummer James Bergstrom, and bassist Byron Hansen.
          
          This band went through several lineup changes culminating with Nick Pollock as their sole guitarist 
          and Bacolas switching to bass before discussions arose about changing their name to Alice in Chains. 
          This was prompted by a conversation that Bacolas had with Russ Klatt, the lead singer of Slaughter 
          Haus, about backstage passes. One of the passes said "Welcome to Wonderland", and they started 
          talking about that being a reference to Alice in Wonderland, until Klatt said, "What about Alice 
          in Chains? Put her in bondage and stuff like that."
          
          Bacolas thought the name "Alice in Chains" was cool and brought it up to his Sleze bandmates and 
          everyone liked it, so they decided to change the name of the band. Due to concerns over the 
          reference to female bondage, the group ultimately chose to spell it differently as Alice N' Chains 
          to allay any parental concerns, though Staley's mother Nancy McCallum has said she was still not
          happy with this name at first. According to Bacolas, the decision to use the apostrophe-N 
          combination in their name had nothing to do with the Los Angeles band Guns N' Roses. The name 
          change happened in 1986, a year before Guns N' Roses became a household name with their first album 
          Appetite for Destruction, released in July 1987.</p>
          <hr>
        <h3 id="p2"><p>MUSICAL STYLE</p></h3>
        <p> Although Alice in Chains has been labeled <em> grunge by the mainstream media</em>,Jerry Cantrell
          identifies the band as primarily heavy metal. He told Guitar World in 1996, "We're a lot of different
          things  ... I don't quite know what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, 
          maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to." The Edmonton 
          Journal has stated, "Living and playing in Seattle might have got them the grunge tag, but they've 
          always pretty much been a classic metal band to the core."

          Over the course of their career, the band's sound has also been described as alternative metal,
          sludge metal,doom metal,[282][283] drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant 
          categorization by the media, Cantrell stated "When we first came out we were metal. Then we started being called 
          alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again 
          I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked 
          into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated 
          back into the metal section. Right back where we started!" Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge
          label, stating in a 2013 interview "I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn't 
          invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal 
          and metal and rock, and we didn't give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!."According 
          to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.
          
          The band are influenced to a great extent by English metal music; in 2018, Jerry Cantrell proclaimed 
          Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi as "one of his biggest" inspirations, whilst Layne Staley named 
          his "first influences" as Black Sabbath and Deep Purple.Cantrell adjudged English rock singer 
          Elton John as "the artist that made me want to be a musician." In addition, members of Alice in 
          Chains have cited artists including AC/DC, Accept, Aerosmith, The Beatles, Black Flag,David Bowie, John Coltrane,
          Miles Davis, Dio, Funkadelic, Hanoi Rocks, Heart, Jimi Hendrix, Iron Maiden, King's X, Kiss, 
          Led Zeppelin, Metallica, MotÃ¶rhead, Mudhoney, Pink Floyd,QueensrÃ¿che, the Rolling Stones, Rush, Scorpions, Soundgarden, 
          The Stooges, Television,Thin Lizzy, U2, UFO, Van Halen, The Velvet Underground, Hank Williams, and ZZ Top 
          as influential or inspirational.
          
          Jerry Cantrell's guitar style combines "pummeling riffs and expansive guitar textures" to create 
          "slow, brooding minor-key grinds". He is also recognized for his natural ability to blend acoustic 
          and electric guitars. While down-tuned, distorted guitars mixed with Staley's distinctive "snarl-to-a-
          scream" vocals appealed to heavy metal fans, the band also had "a sense of melody that was undeniable,
          " which introduced Alice in Chains to a much wider audience outside of the heavy metal underground.
          
          According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, Alice in Chains' sound has a "Black Sabbath-style 
          riffing and an unconventional vocal style." The band has been described by Erlewine as "hard 
          enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front 
          ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands." Three of the band's releases feature acoustic music, 
          and while the band initially kept these releases separate, Alice in Chains' self-titled album combined 
          the styles to form "a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic 
          numbers."
          
          Alice in Chains is also noted for the unique vocal harmonies of Staley (or DuVall) and Cantrell, 
          which included overlapping passages, dual lead vocals, and trademark harmonies typically separated 
          by a major third. Cantrell said it was Staley who gave him the self-assurance to sing his own songs.
           Alyssa Burrows said the band's distinctive sound "came from Staley's vocal style and his lyrics 
          dealing with personal struggles and addiction." Staley's songs were often considered "dark",
          [87] with themes such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide, while Cantrell's lyrics often dealt 
          with personal relationships.</p>
